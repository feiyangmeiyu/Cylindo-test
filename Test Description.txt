The goal is to create a tool that lets you create detail shots from a product image. The tools should follow the mockup.

Key Features:

The user should be able to drag a rectangle with the mouse to mark the part of the image that should be exported as a detail shot.
Once a selection has been made it should be possible to move it by dragging the rectangle with the mouse, and to resize it by dragging the resize handles on the corners.
the selection should show up in the panel on the right, and it should be possible to add new detail shots by clicking the + button. (Ignore this bit.)
The solution must be written in JavaScript or TypeScript using React.

Evaluation
The main goal is to evaluate your ability to solve problems efficiently.

Things that matter:

the code should be as simple as possible while solving the problem.
the outcome should match the mockup, though we do not expect pixel perfection and 100% accurate colors.
We will use your solution as the basis for the technical interview, so be prepared for questions about your design and implementation decisions.
Things that does not matter:

tests (though you are ofc welcome to write as many as you like)
App setup, use Create react app, Gatsby, Next.js or what ever you like.
cross browser compatability, if it works on one of the major browsers we are happy.
Delivery
Create public git repo (github, bitbucket, gitlab your choice) and send the link to andreas@cylindo.com. Make sure to include a README.md with instruction on how to build and run your app.
